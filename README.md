# day125
test

I got some problems after I update the new OX captain thing, now I think I fixed them, and I haven't post any code in about 3 dyas, I think the hongbo100 project should end, since I actually don't have that much time to think of a new project everyday, and I don't think so many small projects would do anything good about my career and future, so I stop today.

But I would still work on my own private project from the day 126, I would like to create a new repo for that to record my working process on my private project, so... That's it.
